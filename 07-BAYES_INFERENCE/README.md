## bayes_confirmed.tar.gz
nexus files used for Bayesian inference on six of the nine confirmed HGTs (ML00955a, ML00555a, ML005129a, ML02771a, ML49231a, ML42441a) and resulting output files. We did not perform phylogenetic analyses on the remaining three HGTs since homologous sequences were absent in all other animals.
