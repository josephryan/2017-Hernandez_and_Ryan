files from RefSeq_Accessions.tar.gz contain the blast top hits of HGT candidates against NCBI's RefSeq database. These are the original files and contain accession numbers. The files were later concatenated for phylogenetic analyses and used the following naming scheme: BAC = bacteria
EUK = non-animal eukaryotes, PLA = plants, FUN = fungi, MET = animals.
