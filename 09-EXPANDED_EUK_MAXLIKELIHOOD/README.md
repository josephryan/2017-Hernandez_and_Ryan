maximum likelihood analyses performed with expanded protistan taxonomic sampling for six of the nine confirmed HGTs (ML00955a, ML00555a, ML005129a, ML02771a, ML49231a, ML42441a). The analyses were performed on sequences from the original alignments and additional homologous sequences identified in protists from the Ensembl Protists database.
