# likelihood_violins.R

script generates likelihood proportions by taking individual likelihood values for each tree and dividing them by the average likelihood value for suboptimal trees. The script makes it possible to visualize comparisons for likelihood scores between the best tree (i.e., tree indicating HGT), metazoan constraint tree, and suboptimal trees.
